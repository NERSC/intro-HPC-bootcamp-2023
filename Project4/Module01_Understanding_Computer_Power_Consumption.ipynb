        "## Introduction to Power and Energy Consumption\n",
        "In the world of computing, power and energy consumption are critical aspects that influence not only the performance but also the efficiency and sustainability of computing devices. From personal computers to high-performance computing (HPC) systems, understanding how power is consumed is essential for optimizing performance and reducing environmental impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Power Consumption?\n",
        "Power consumption refers to the amount of electrical energy consumed by a device or system to perform its functions. It is usually measured in watts (W) and represents the rate at which energy is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Energy Consumption?\n",
        "Energy consumption is the total amount of energy consumed over a specific period. It is measured in watt-hours (Wh) or kilowatt-hours (kWh) and represents the overall energy used by a device.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is Understanding Power and Energy Consumption Important?\n",
        "1. **Performance Optimization:** By understanding how power is consumed, we can optimize the performance of computing devices, ensuring that they run efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Processing Power**: The more powerful the GPU, the more energy it consumes. High-end graphics cards require more energy to perform complex calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cooling Systems**: Graphics cards generate a lot of heat, especially during intensive tasks. Cooling systems, such as fans and liquid cooling, are used to dissipate this heat, consuming additional energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Memory Usage**: GPUs come with their own dedicated video memory (VRAM) that stores textures, frame buffers, and other graphical data. Accessing and utilizing this memory consumes energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Voltage and Frequency**: The operating voltage and frequency of a GPU also determine its energy consumption. Overclocking, or running the GPU at higher-than-rated speeds, increases both performance and energy consumption.\n",

        "### Graphics Cards in HPC Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "In HPC systems, graphics cards are not just used for rendering images but also for performing parallel computations. They play a crucial role in accelerating scientific simulations, deep learning, and other compute-intensive tasks. In such scenarios, energy consumption becomes a critical factor:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multiple GPUs**: HPC systems often use multiple GPUs working in tandem. This multi-GPU setup increases the overall energy consumption.\n",

        "2. **Analyze a Real GPU**: Choose a real-world GPU (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla V100) and analyze its energy consumption characteristics. Compare it with a standard GPU used in personal computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Explore HPC GPU Usage**: Research how GPUs are used in a specific HPC system (e.g., Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit). Analyze the energy consumption patterns and the measures taken to optimize energy efficiency.\n",
