        "# Module 5: Project 4 - Exploring Energy Sustainability in High-Performance Computing (HPC)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Overview\n",
        "High-performance computing (HPC) has led to significant scientific advances across various fields. HPC allows researchers to simulate complex phenomena and systems that were previously impossible to study due to their size, complexity, or time scales. For example, HPC has been used in climate modeling to predict future climate patterns and understand the impacts of climate change. HPC has also been instrumental in drug discovery, where researchers can simulate the interactions between molecules and predict their efficacy and potential side effects, thus accelerating the drug development process. HPC has also played a crucial role in astrophysics, enabling the simulation of galaxy formations and the study of the origins of the universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the power consumption and cooling requirements of HPC systems pose significant challenges. HPC systems are typically power-hungry and generate large amounts of heat. The energy consumption and associated costs for operating these systems are substantial. Cooling the systems is also a major concern, as excessive heat can damage the equipment and affect their performance. To address these issues, significant efforts have been made to develop more energy-efficient architectures and cooling technologies for HPC systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to delve into the intersection of social justice, energy, and power sustainability by exploring the significance of energy-efficient computing. Participants will work to understand the relationship between the location of Green500 and Top500 HPC systems and climate change indicators and low-income energy affordability data, seeking to answer the question: are HPC systems well placed for energy sustainability?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goal of Module 5\n",
        "In this module, you will work on a project that explores the relationship between the location of Green500 and Top500 HPC systems, climate change indicators, and low-income energy affordability data. The goal is to answer the question: are HPC systems well placed for energy sustainability? This project will help you understand the significance of energy-efficient computing and its intersection with social justice and power sustainability."
