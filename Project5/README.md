# Project 5: Energy Cost for Disadvantaged Populations and Methods of Energy Efficiency and Energy Optimization in Computing Systems

## Overview

High-performance computing (HPC) systems require massive amounts of power, and inefficient code can lead to excessive energy usage. By improving code efficiency, less energy is required to perform computations, leading to reduced environmental impact and lower energy costs. HPC systems consume substantial resources, including electricity and cooling infrastructure. These resources are not evenly distributed globally, and their availability can be limited in certain regions. Just as large scale computing systems can be used more efficiently with optimized code, efficiency practices can improve power consumption for all parts of our power infrastructure. This approach promotes a more sustainable use of computing resources, aligning with the principles of energy justice and reducing the environmental impact of HPC systems. 

In this project, participants will learn how to optimize energy consumption in computing systems. Participants will delve into programming languages, specifically Python, to optimize code for parallel processing, enabling efficient utilization of system resources. Additionally, participants will explore energy efficiency in our power infrastructure and how it is measured and improved. 

Project 5 covers all the contents in Project 4, plus an additional module on Understanding Methods to Optimize Energy Consumption.

### Understanding Power and Energy Consumption in HPC


High Performance Computing (HPC) systems are at the forefront of scientific research, enabling complex simulations, data analysis, and solving intricate problems that are otherwise infeasible with conventional computing resources. However, the importance of power and energy consumption in HPC systems cannot be overstated. The massive computational power demanded by these systems leads to high energy requirements, resulting in significant environmental and economic implications. Efficient power management is crucial to ensure the sustainability of HPC centers and reduce their carbon footprint. Excessive power consumption not only escalates operational costs but also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, impacting the environment and exacerbating climate change.


Efforts to optimize energy consumption in HPC systems can lead to energy justice and sustainability. Energy justice refers to the equitable distribution of benefits and burdens related to energy production and consumption. By addressing power efficiency in HPC, it becomes possible to reduce the strain on local power grids and alleviate the risk of energy shortages, which often disproportionately affect low-income communities. Additionally, improved energy efficiency can lower the overall cost of running HPC systems, making these resources more accessible to researchers and organizations with limited financial means. Striving for sustainability and energy justice in HPC not only benefits society by democratizing access to advanced computing capabilities but also aligns with global initiatives to mitigate the impacts of climate change.


Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that power and energy consumption are fundamental considerations in High Performance Computing systems. Enhancing energy efficiency in HPC is not only crucial for the sustainable operation of these systems but also plays a role in promoting energy justice and making advanced computational resources more accessible to all, including low-income communities. By prioritizing power optimization, HPC centers can contribute to a greener, more equitable future while continuing to drive scientific innovation and discovery.
